# Show Orchard Theme

## About

This is the theme for [Show Orchard](https://showorchard.com) hosted on [DotNest](https://dotnest.com). Lately, it has been migrated to Orchard Core (read the [case study](https://dotnest.com/blog/show-orchard-case-study-migrating-an-orchard-1-dotnest-site-to-orchard-core) to see how it was done). It's also a [Media Theme](https://github.com/Lombiq/Hosting-Media-Theme) so it can be used as a sample project for creating your own Media Theme on DotNest.

The goal of Show Orchard is to collect all the representative Orchard websites in one place. This project was originally started and developed by [Ryan Drew Burnett](https://github.com/RyanDBurnett). Since 2017 it's developed by [Lombiq](https://lombiq.com).

## Documentation

It's recommended to use this theme with your fork of the [DotNest Core Sites SDK](https://github.com/Lombiq/DotNest-Core-SDK). See its readme for more information.
